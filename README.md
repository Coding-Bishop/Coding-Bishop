- 👋 Hi, I’m @Coding-Bishop
- 👀 I’m interested in arranging the code that is already out there in a financially fullfilling way and leave my mark in the tech space. Are you?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, C++, Python, HTML and CSS... the list is long and winding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any coding project that will leave my brain fired up, can't wait.

let's link and create beatiful and efficient codes.
